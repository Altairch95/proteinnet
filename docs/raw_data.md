# Raw Data
The raw data comprising all MSAs for ProteinNet12 is available for download upon request. The data is large, approximately 4TB in size, and requires a Globus client for downloading. Please [email us](mailto:alquraishi@hms.harvard.edu) to request access.

Once we are able to provide broad access we will post a public Globus endpoint for all ProteinNets.
