# Raw Data
The current preliminary release of ProteinNet does not include any of the raw data used to build ProteinNet, but the full release will. The raw data will consist of:

* Raw structure files containing secondary and tertiary structures
* Sequence databases used in building multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of protein sequences
* MSAs used in building position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) which can be used for co-evolutionary analyses
* Additional types of PSSMs (current ones are derived using JackHMMer)
* More complete documentation of ProteinNet construction pipeline

Stay tuned!
